# TST editor

This repository contains an editing interface for the TST project. To use the editor, go to https://tst-project.github.io/Tamil/tst-editor/

## How to create a manuscript record

When you open the editor, you will be asked to either start a new file or select an existing file from your computer. If there are any autosaved files, they will also appear there.

### A basic record

The editor presents a rich interface that can be used to create very detailed records. But, at a minimum, your record should contain:

* a shelfmark
* a manuscript title (which can be the title of the text, or a descriptive title, such as "fragment of the Kantapurāṇam")
* your name
* your institutional affiliation
* a summary description of the manuscript
* a physical description (material, extent, leaf size)
* the title of the text(s) contained in the manuscript
* the transcription conventions and abbreviations used in the record

Those fields, in the editor, are marked with a dashed red line if they are empty, to indicate that they are required. When you have filled them out, click "preview" to see your record formatted. When you are satisfied, click "save as..." to save the XML file to your computer, and submit it to the TST project.
